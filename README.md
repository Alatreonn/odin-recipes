# odin-recipes
Tutorial for personal use
For this project, I am about to implement my
existing knowledge, as of now, to create a
website for food recipes. Skill will come in time,
and despite looking crude, my aim is to *perfect* it
with time.

Git and Github will be a great assistance in this
journey and also essential because it will simulate
a real work enviroment in its basic and simple form.
